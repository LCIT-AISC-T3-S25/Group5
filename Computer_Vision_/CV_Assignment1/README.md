|Gokul Krishna            | Preprocessing was done - did Intensity Thresholds, Histogram Equalization, resizing, Gaussian Blur
|Yugahang Limbu            |Performed initial preprocessing tasks including scaling and image resizing, followed by additional image augmentation, and integrated the images with other features. Splitted preprocessed data into training, testing and validation set
